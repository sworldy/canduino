This is the project for implementing the CAN protocol with arduino and arduino based microcontroller systems.
Initially the project is based on the Microchip MCP2515 and the Arduino Microcontroller board.
**This project is now in the BETA stage.**

As well as a Breakout Board for the Freescale MPXH6400A Pressure Sensor...

**Will mate up with all arduino compliant devices.**

**I will be working on better demo code as well, but would appreciate any help in getting this project going so that less experienced users can begin learning how to implement this protocol.**

This project is still in its infancy, please keep checking back for more updates.
Anyone who wants to contribute is welcome!
Please contact me for more information.
